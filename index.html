  <h3>About me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Kenneth Butler. Thanks for taking the time to look at my Portfolio website
</p>
<p>
I'm currently on break from college at Florida Gulf Coast University where I was pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I was 6 credits shy of being considered Junior in college. This is for the current year of 2018. As it is right now, I am currently not sure if I'm going to go back for personal reasons. This has given me more time to focus on work and also try to learn code on the side via codeschool and udemy courses.
</p>
<p>I hope to find an internship this year or a job this year so I can focus even more on learning developer skills while starting the career!</p>
<p>I have to start somewhere and can only improve!</p>
<p>My hobby is playing guitar and bass. Would like to join as a guitarist for an alt rock band or as a bassist for a Bee Gees cover band or something of the sort!</p>
