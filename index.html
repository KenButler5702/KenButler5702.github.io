  <h3>About me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Kenneth Butler. Thanks for taking the time to look at my Portfolio website, be it as an employer or a musician. <small> (or both) </small></p>
<p>I'm currently attending Florida Gulf Coast University for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems and expect to graduate in 2019-2020.</p>
<p>Why Computer Information Systems? Because I'm a nerd and like the idea of having a computer compute a bunch of work with code, assisting in music, and information gathering that I could never accomplish on my own so quickly. I hope to have a strong career in the field of computers and hope to create or be part of the creation of applications and software someday that many individuals will use. </p>
<p>While I attend college I work part-time jobs and spend my spare time at home learning various programming languages, <i>(ones I'm currently learning/have learned will be on the skills page,)</i> and practice music primarily on guitar. I've only begun my self-code learning with serious focus since November of 2016, I've always been interested in it, however, it clicked one day and now it's become something I genuinely enjoy.  For both coding and musicianship, I always strive to learn more and feel like I must learn more.</p>
<p>It is a never-ending greed for me regarding the want to further myself each day at both.</p>
